A repository for my computational physics research projects under Dr. Ilya Esterlis and Dr. Duncan Carlsmith.
Projects range various topics including Langevin mechanics & Brownian motion, numerical solvers of ODEs/PDEs, and aerodynamic simulations.
I will add more projects here as I continue doing research with professors or independently.
